# Theme Generator

This is a work-in-progress site project aimed at helping to generate color palettes and accessible text text colors for use on each palette color

## Live demo

Available live on GitHub Pages here: https://danielpickett.github.io/theme-generator/k

## Repo structure

This is a monorepo using Nx and Parcel.

To get it running locally, just run...

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

Nx will take care of building the workspace dependencies and will launch the primary demo app for the theme-generator package.
