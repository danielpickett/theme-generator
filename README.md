This is a work-in-progress rebuild of my `lch-palette-generator` repo. The functionality isn't there yet, but the performance problems of the previous version have been solved using Recoil, web workers and offscreen canvas. Still working toward feature parity.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To get it running, run `yarn`, then run `yarn start`.
