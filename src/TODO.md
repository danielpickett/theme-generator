# TODO

- display all vivid text colors on grey
- hide 'grey-vivid'
- selector and token aliases for primary shade of a scale
- Add '\_\_UNSAFE' flag to subdued tokens output

# Wish List

- Draggable output drawer
- Make only the primary shade of a scale draggable on the chroma slider and make the rest fall in line behind it.
